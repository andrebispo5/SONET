     [java] Chapter I
     [java]    An Unexpected Party
     [java]      
     [java]  In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with 
     [java] the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing 
     [java] in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.
     [java]      It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny 
     [java] yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall 
     [java] like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and 
     [java] floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs 
     [java] for hats and coats - the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, 
     [java] going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill - The Hill, as all the 
     [java] people for many miles round called it - and many little round doors opened out of 
     [java] it, first on one side and then on another. No going upstairs for the hobbit: 
     [java] bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole 
     [java] rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and 
     [java] indeed on the same passage. The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (going 
     [java] in), for these were the only ones to have windows, deep-set round windows looking 
     [java] over his garden and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river.
     [java]      This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins. The 
     [java] Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and 
     [java] people considered them very respectable, not only because most of them were rich, 
     [java] but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected: you 
     [java] could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking 
     [java] him. This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, found himself doing and 
     [java] saying things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the neighbours' respect, but 
     [java] he gained-well, you will see whether he gained anything in the end.
     [java]      The mother of our particular hobbit … what is a hobbit? I suppose hobbits 
     [java] need some description nowadays, since they have become rare and shy of the Big 
     [java] People, as they call us. They are (or were) a little people, about half our height, and 
     [java] smaller than the bearded Dwarves. Hobbits have no beards. There is little or no 
     [java] magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear 
     [java] quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, 
     [java] making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off. They are inclined to 
     [java] be  at in the stomach; they dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); wear 
     [java] no shoes, because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair 
     [java] like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long clever brown fingers, good-
     [java] natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which they 
     [java] have twice a day when they can get it). Now you know enough to go on with. As I 
     [java] was saying, the mother of this hobbit - of Bilbo Baggins, that is - was the fabulous 
     [java] Belladonna Took, one of the three remarkable daughters of the Old Took, head of 
     [java] the hobbits who lived across The Water, the small river that ran at the foot of The 
     [java] Hill. It was often said (in other families) that long ago one of the Took ancestors 
     [java] must have taken a fairy wife. That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was 
     [java] still something not entirely hobbit-like about them, - and once in a while members 
     [java] of the Took-clan would go and have adventures. They discreetly disappeared, and 
     [java] the family hushed it up; but the fact remained that the Tooks were not as 
     [java] respectable as the Bagginses, though they were undoubtedly richer. Not that 
     [java] Belladonna Took ever had any adventures after she became Mrs. Bungo Baggins. 
     [java] Bungo, that was Bilbo's father, built the most luxurious hobbit-hole for her (and 
     [java] partly with her money) that was to be found either under The Hill or over The Hill 
     [java] or across The Water, and there they remained to the end of their days. Still it is 
     [java] probable that Bilbo, her only son, although he looked and behaved exactly like a 
     [java] second edition of his solid and comfortable father, got something a bit queer in his 
     [java] makeup from the Took side, something that only waited for a chance to come out. 
     [java] The chance never arrived, until Bilbo Baggins was grown up, being about fifty 
     [java] years old or so, and living in the beautiful hobbit-hole built by his father, which I 
     [java] have just described for you, until he had in fact apparently settled down 
     [java] immovably.
     [java]      By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when 
     [java] there was less noise and more green, and the hobbits were still numerous and 
     [java] prosperous, and Bilbo Baggins was standing at his door after breakfast smoking an 
     [java] enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down to his woolly toes (neatly 
     [java] brushed) - Gandalf came by. Gandalf! If you had heard only a quarter of what I 
     [java] have heard about him, and I have only heard very little of all there is to hear, you 
     [java] would be prepared for any sort I of remarkable tale. Tales and adventures sprouted 
     [java] up all over the place wherever he went, in the most extraordinary fashion. He had 
     [java] not been down that way under The Hill for ages and ages, not since his friend the 
     [java] Old Took died, in fact, and the hobbits had almost forgotten what he looked like. 
     [java] He had been away over The Hill and across The Water on business of his own 
     [java] since they were all small hobbit-boys and hobbit-girls.
     [java]      All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. 
     [java] He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which a white 
     [java] beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots.
     [java]      "Good morning!" said Bilbo, and he meant it. The sun was shining, and the 
     [java] grass was very green. But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows 
     [java] that stuck out further than the brim of his shady hat. "What do you mean?" he said. 
     [java] "Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want 
     [java] not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is morning to be good on?"
     [java]      "All of them at once," said Bilbo. "And a very fine morning for a pipe of 
     [java] tobacco out of doors, into the bargain. If you have a pipe about you, sit down and 
     [java] have a fill of mine! There's no hurry, we have all the day before us!" Then Bilbo sat 
     [java] down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs, and blew out a beautiful grey ring of 
     [java] smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking and floated away over The Hill.
     [java]      "Very pretty!" said Gandalf. "But I have no time to blow smoke-rings this 
     [java] morning. I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging, 
     [java] and it's very difficult to find anyone."
     [java]      “I should think so - in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no use for 
     [java] adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner! I 
     [java] can’t think what anybody sees in them,” said our Mr. Baggins, and stuck one thumb 
     [java] behind his braces, and blew out another even bigger smoke-ring. Then he took out 
     [java] his morning letters, and begin to read, pretending to take no more notice of the old 
     [java] man. He had decided that he was not quite his sort, and wanted him to go away. But 
     [java] the old man did not move. He stood leaning on his stick and gazing at the hobbit 
     [java] without saying anything, till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even a little cross.
     [java]      "Good morning!" he said at last. "We don't want any adventures here, thank 
     [java] you! You might try over The Hill or across The Water." By this he meant that the 
     [java] conversation was at an end.
     [java]      "What a lot of things you do use Good morning for!" said Gandalf. "Now you 
     [java] mean that you want to get rid of me, and that it won't be good till I move off."
     [java]      "Not at all, not at all, my dear sir! Let me see, I don't think I know your 
     [java] name?"
     [java]      "Yes, yes, my dear sir - and I do know your name, Mr. Bilbo Baggins. And 
     [java] you do know my name, though you don't remember that I belong to it. I am 
     [java] Gandalf, and Gandalf means me! To think that I should have lived to be good-
     [java] morninged by Belladonna Took's son, as if I was selling buttons at the door!"
     [java]      "Gandalf, Gandalf! Good gracious me! Not the wandering wizard that gave 
     [java] Old Took a pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came 
     [java] undone till ordered? Not the fellow who used to tell such wonderful tales at parties, 
     [java] about dragons and goblins and giants and the rescue of princesses and the 
     [java] unexpected luck of widows' sons? Not the man that used to make such particularly 
     [java] excellent fireworks! I remember those! Old Took used to have them on 
     [java] Midsummer's Eve. Splendid! They used to go up like great lilies and snapdragons 
     [java] and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all evening!" You will notice already 
     [java] that Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe, also that he was very 
     [java] fond of flowers. "Dear me!" he went on. "Not the Gandalf who was responsible for 
     [java] so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures. Anything 
     [java] from climbing trees to visiting Elves - or sailing in ships, sailing to other shores! 
     [java] Bless me, life used to be quite inter - I mean, you used to upset things badly in 
     [java] these parts once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no idea you were still in 
     [java] business."
     [java]      "Where else should I be?" said the wizard. "All the same I am pleased to find 
     [java] you remember something about me. You seem to remember my fireworks kindly, at 
     [java] any rate, land that is not without hope. Indeed for your old grand-father Took's 
     [java] sake, and for the sake of poor Belladonna, I will give you what you asked for."
     [java]      "I beg your pardon, I haven't asked for anything!"
     [java]      "Yes, you have! Twice now. My pardon. I give it you. In fact I will go so far 
     [java] as to send you on this adventure. Very amusing for me, very good for you and 
     [java] profitable too, very likely, if you ever get over it."
     [java]      "Sorry! I don't want any adventures, thank you. Not today. Good morning! 
     [java] But please come to tea - any time you like! Why not tomorrow? Come tomorrow! 
     [java] Good-bye!"
     [java]      With that the hobbit turned and scuttled inside his round green door, and shut 
     [java] it as quickly as he dared, not to seen rude. Wizards after all are wizards.
     [java]      "What on earth did I ask him to tea for!" he said to him-self, as he went to the 
     [java] pantry. He had only just had break fast, but he thought a cake or two and a drink of 
     [java] something would do him good after his fright. Gandalf in the meantime was still 
     [java] standing outside the door, and laughing long but quietly. After a while he stepped 
     [java] up, and with the spike of his staff scratched a queer sign on the hobbit's beautiful 
     [java] green front-door. Then he strode away, just about the time when Bilbo was 
     [java] finishing his second cake and beginning to think that he had escape adventures very 
     [java] well.
     [java]      The next day he had almost forgotten about Gandalf. He did not remember 
     [java] things very well, unless he put them down on his Engagement Tablet: like this: 
     [java] Gandalf Tea Wednesday. Yesterday he had been too flustered to do anything of the 
     [java] kind. Just before tea-time there came a tremendous ring on the front-door bell, and 
     [java] then he remembered! He rushed and put on the kettle, and put out another cup and 
     [java] saucer and an extra cake or two, and ran to the door.
     [java]      "I am so sorry to keep you waiting!" he was going to say, when he saw that it 
     [java] was not Gandalf at all. It was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden belt, 
     [java] and very bright eyes under his dark-green hood. As soon a the door was opened, he 
     [java] pushed inside, just as if he had been expected.
     [java]      He hung his hooded cloak on the nearest peg, and "Dwalin at your service!" 
     [java] he said with a low bow.
     [java]      "Bilbo Baggins at yours!" said the hobbit, too surprised to ask any questions 
     [java] for the moment. When the silence that followed had become uncomfortable, he 
     [java] added: "I am just about to take tea; pray come and have some with me." A little 
     [java] stiff perhaps, but he meant it kindly. And what would you do, if an uninvited dwarf 
     [java] came and hung his things up in your hall without a word of explanation?
     [java]      They had not been at table long, in fact they had hardly reached the third 
     [java] cake, when there came another even louder ring at the bell.
     [java]      "Excuse me!" said the hobbit, and off he went to the door.
     [java]      "So you have got here at last!" was what he was going to say to Gandalf this 
     [java] time. But it was not Gandalf. Instead there was a very old-looking dwarf on the step 
     [java] with a white beard and a scarlet hood; and he too hopped inside as soon as the door 
     [java] was open, just as if he had been invited.
     [java]      "I see they have begun to arrive already," he said when he caught sight of 
     [java] Dwalin's green hood hanging up. He hung his red one next to it, and "Balin at your 
     [java] service!" he said with his hand on his breast.
     [java]      "Thank you!" said Bilbo with a gasp. It was not the correct thing to say, but 
     [java] they have begun to arrive had flustered him badly. He liked visitors, but he liked to 
     [java] know them before they arrived, and he preferred to ask them himself. He had a 
     [java] horrible thought that the cakes might run short, and then he-as the host: he knew his 
     [java] duty and stuck to it however painful-he might have to go without.
     [java]      "Come along in, and have some tea!" he managed to say after taking a deep 
     [java] breath.
     [java]      "A little beer would suit me better, if it is all the same to you, my good sir," 
     [java] said Balin with the white beard. "But I don't mind some cake-seed-cake, if you have 
     [java] any."
     [java]      "Lots!" Bilbo found himself answering, to his own surprise; and he found 
     [java] himself scuttling off, too, to the cellar to fill a pint beer-mug, and to the pantry to 
     [java] fetch two beautiful round seed-cakes which he had baked that afternoon for his 
     [java] after-supper morsel.
     [java]      When he got back Balin and Dwalin were talking at the table like old friends 
     [java] (as a matter of fact they were brothers). Bilbo plumped down the beer and the cake 
     [java] in front of them, when loud came a ring at the bell again, and then another ring.
     [java]      "Gandalf for certain this time," he thought as he puffed along the passage. But 
     [java] it was not. It was two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and yellow 
     [java] beards; and each of them carried a bag of tools and a spade. In they hopped, as 
     [java] soon as the door began to open-Bilbo was hardly surprised at all.
     [java]      "What can I do for you, my dwarves?" he said. "Kili at your service!" said the 
     [java] one. "And Fili!" added the other; and they both swept off their blue hoods and 
     [java] bowed.
     [java]      "At yours and your family's!" replied Bilbo, remembering his manners this 
     [java] time.
     [java]      "Dwalin and Balin here already, I see," said Kili. "Let us join the throng!"
     [java]      "Throng!" thought Mr. Baggins. "I don't like the sound of that. I really must 
     [java] sit down for a minute and collect my wits, and have a drink." He had only just had a 
     [java] sip-in the corner, while the four dwarves sat around the table, and talked about 
     [java] mines and gold and troubles with the goblins, and the depredations of dragons, and 
     [java] lots of other things which he did not understand, and did not want to, for they 
     [java] sounded much too adventurous-when, ding-dong-a-ling-' dang, his bell rang again, 
     [java] as if some naughty little hobbit-boy was trying to pull the handle off. "Someone at 
     [java] the door!" he said, blinking. "Some four, I should say by the sound," said Fili. "Be-
     [java] sides, we saw them coming along behind us in the distance."
     [java]      The poor little hobbit sat down in the hall and put his head in his hands, and 
     [java] wondered what had happened, and what was going to happen, and whether they 
     [java] would all stay to supper. Then the bell rang again louder than ever, and he had to 
     [java] run to the door. It was not four after all, t was FIVE. Another dwarf had come along 
     [java] while he was wondering in the hall. He had hardly turned the knob, be-x)re they 
     [java] were all inside, bowing and saying "at your service" one after another. Dori, Nori, 
     [java] Ori, Oin, and Gloin were their names; and very soon two purple hoods, a grey 
     [java] hood, a brown hood, and a white hood were hanging on the pegs, and off they 
     [java] marched with their broad hands stuck in their gold and silver belts to join the 
     [java] others. Already it had almost become a throng. Some called for ale, and some for 
     [java] porter, and one for coffee, and all of them for cakes; so the hobbit was kept very 
     [java] busy for a while.
     [java]      A big jug of coffee bad just been set in the hearth, the seed-cakes were gone, 
     [java] and the dwarves were starting on a round of buttered scones, when there came-a 
     [java] loud knock. Not a ring, but a hard rat-tat on the hobbit's beautiful green door. 
     [java] Somebody was banging with a stick!
     [java]      Bilbo rushed along the passage, very angry, and altogether bewildered and 
     [java] bewuthered-this was the most awkward Wednesday he ever remembered. He pulled 
     [java] open the door with a jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other. More 
     [java] dwarves, four more! And there was Gandalf behind, leaning on his staff and 
     [java] laughing. He had made quite a dent on the beautiful door; he had also, by the way, 
     [java] knocked out the secret mark that he had put there the morning before.
     [java]      "Carefully! Carefully!" he said. "It is not like you, Bilbo, to keep friends 
     [java] waiting on the mat, and then open the door like a pop-gun! Let me introduce Bifur, 
     [java] Bofur, Bombur, and especially Thorin!"
     [java]      "At your service!" said Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur standing in a row. Then 
     [java] they hung up two yellow hoods and a pale green one; and also a sky-blue one with 
     [java] a long silver tassel. This last belonged to Thorin, an enormously important dwarf, 
     [java] in fact no other than the great Thorin Oakenshield himself, who was not at all 
     [java] pleased at falling flat on Bilbo's mat with Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur on top of him. 
     [java] For one thing Bombur was immensely fat and heavy. Thorin indeed was very 
     [java] haughty, and said nothing about service; but poor Mr. Baggins said he was sorry so 
     [java] many times, that at last he grunted "pray don't mention it," and stopped frowning.
     [java]      "Now we are all here!" said Gandalf, looking at the row of thirteen hoods-the 
     [java] best detachable party hoods-and his own hat hanging on the pegs. "Quite a merry 
     [java] gathering!
     [java]      I hope there is something left for the late-comers to eat and drink! What's 
     [java] that? Tea! No thank you! A little red wine, I think, for me." "And for me," said 
     [java] Thorin. "And raspberry jam and apple-tart," said Bifur. "And mince-pies and 
     [java] cheese," said Bofur. "And pork-pie and salad," said Bombur. "And more cakes-and 
     [java] ale-and coffee, if you don't mind," called the other dwarves through the door.
     [java]      "Put on a few eggs, there's a good fellow!" Gandalf called after him, as the 
     [java] hobbit stumped off to the pantries. "And just bring out the cold chicken and 
     [java] pickles!"
     [java]      "Seems to know as much about the inside of my larders as I do myself!" 
     [java] thought Mr. Baggins, who was feeling positively flummoxed, and was beginning to 
     [java] wonder whether a most wretched adventure had not come right into his house. By 
     [java] the time he had got all the bottles and dishes and knives and forks and glasses and 
     [java] plates and spoons and things piled up on big trays, he was getting very hot, and red 
     [java] in the face, and annoyed.
     [java]      "Confusticate and bebother these dwarves!" he said aloud. "Why don't they 
     [java] come and lend a hand?" Lo and behold! there stood Balin and Dwalin at the door of 
     [java] the kitchen, and Fili and Kili behind them, and before he could say knife they had 
     [java] whisked the trays and a couple of small tables into the parlour and set out 
     [java] everything afresh.
     [java]      Gandalf sat at the head of the party with the thirteen, dwarves all round: and 
     [java] Bilbo sat on a stool at the fireside, nibbling at a biscuit (his appetite was quite taken 
     [java] away), and trying to look as if this was all perfectly ordinary and. not in the least an 
     [java] adventure. The dwarves ate and ate, and talked and talked, and time got on. At last 
     [java] they pushed their chairs back, and Bilbo made a move to collect the plates and 
     [java] glasses.
     [java]      "I suppose you will all stay to supper?" he said in his politest unpressing 
     [java] tones. "Of course!" said Thorin. "And after. We shan't get through the business till 
     [java] late, and we must have some music first. Now to clear up!"
     [java]      Thereupon the twelve dwarves-not Thorin, he was too important, and stayed 
     [java] talking to Gandalf-jumped to their feet and made tall piles of all the things. Off they 
     [java] went, not waiting for trays, balancing columns of plates, each with a bottle on the 
     [java] top, with one hand, while the hobbit ran after them almost squeaking with fright: 
     [java] "please be careful!" and "please, don't trouble! I can manage." But the dwarves 
     [java] only started to sing:
     [java]      
     [java] Chip the glasses and crack the plates!
     [java] Blunt the knives and bend the forks!
     [java] That's what Bilbo Baggins hates-
     [java] Smash the bottles and burn the corks!
     [java] Cut the cloth and tread on the fat!
     [java] Pour the milk on the pantry floor!
     [java] Leave the bones on the bedroom mat!
     [java] Splash the wine on every door!
     [java]      
     [java] Dump the crocks in a boiling bawl;
     [java] Pound them up with a thumping pole;
     [java] And when you've finished, if any are whole,
     [java] Send them down the hall to roll !
     [java] That's what Bilbo Baggins hates!
     [java] So, carefully! carefully with the plates!
     [java]      
     [java]      And of course they did none of these dreadful things, and everything was 
     [java] cleaned and put away safe as quick as lightning, while the hobbit was turning round 
     [java] and round in the middle of the kitchen trying to see what they were doing. Then 
     [java] they went back, and found Thorin with his feet on the fender smoking a pipe. He 
     [java] was blowing the most enormous smoke-rings, and wherever he told one to go, it 
     [java] went-up the chimney, or behind the clock on the mantelpiece, or under the table, or 
     [java] round and round the ceiling; but wherever it went it was not quick enough to escape 
     [java] Gandalf. Pop! he sent a smaller smoke-ring from his short clay-pipe straight 
     [java] through each one of Thorin's. The Gandalf's smoke-ring would go green and come 
     [java] back to hover over the wizard's head. He had quite a cloud of them about him 
     [java] already, and in the dim light it made him look strange and sorcerous. Bilbo stood 
     [java] still and watched-he loved smoke-rings-and then be blushed to think how proud he 
     [java] had been yesterday morning of the smoke-rings he had sent up the wind over The 
     [java] Hill.
     [java]      "Now for some music!" said Thorin. "Bring out the instruments!"
     [java]      Kili and Fili rushed for their bags and brought back little fiddles; Dori, Nori, 
     [java] and Ori brought out flutes from somewhere inside their coats; Bombur produced a 
     [java] drum from the hall; Bifur and Bofur went out too, and came back with clarinets that 
     [java] they had left among the walking-sticks Dwalin and Balin said: "Excuse me, I left 
     [java] mine in the porch!" "Just bring mine in with you," said Thorin. They came back 
     [java] with viols as big as themselves, and with Thorin’s harp wrapped in a green cloth. It 
     [java] was a beautiful gold-en harp, and when Thorin struck it the music began all at once, 
     [java] so sudden and sweet that Bilbo forgot everything else, and was swept away into 
     [java] dark lands under strange moons, far over The Water and very far from his hobbit-
     [java] hole under The Hill.
     [java]      The dark came into the room from the little window that opened in the side of 
     [java] The Hill; the firelight flickered-it was April-and still they played on, while the 
     [java] shadow of Gandalf's beard wagged against the wall.
     [java]      The dark filled all the room, and the fire died down, and the shadows were 
     [java] lost, and still they played on. And suddenly first one and then another began to sing 
     [java] as they played, deep-throated singing of the dwarves in the deep places of their 
     [java] ancient homes; and this is like a fragment of their song, if it can be like their song 
     [java] without their music.
     [java]      
     [java]                     Far over the misty mountains cold
     [java]                     To dungeons deep and caverns old
     [java]                     We must away ere break of day
     [java]                     To seek the pale enchanted gold.
     [java]                     
     [java]                     The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,
     [java]                     While hammers fell like ringing bells
     [java]                     In places deep, where dark things sleep,
     [java]                     In hollow halls beneath the fells.
     [java]                     
     [java]                     For ancient king and elvish lord
     [java]                     There many a gloaming golden hoard
     [java]                     They shaped and wrought, and light they caught
     [java]                     To hide in gems on hilt of sword.
     [java]                     
     [java]                     On silver necklaces they strung
     [java]                     The flowering stars, on crowns they hung
     [java]                     The dragon-fire, in twisted wire
     [java]                     They meshed the light of moon and sun.
     [java]                     
     [java]                     Far over the misty mountains cold
     [java]                     To dungeons deep and caverns old
     [java]                     We must away, ere break of day,
     [java]                     To claim our long-forgotten gold.
     [java]                     
     [java]                     Goblets they carved there for themselves
     [java]                     And harps of gold; where no man delves
     [java]                     There lay they long, and many a song
     [java]                     Was sung unheard by men or elves.
     [java]                     
     [java]                     The pines were roaring on the height,
     [java]                     The winds were moaning in the night.
     [java]                     The fire was red, it flaming spread;
     [java]                     The trees like torches biased with light,
     [java]                     
     [java]                     The bells were ringing in the dale
     [java]                     And men looked up with faces pale;
     [java]                     The dragon's ire more fierce than fire
     [java]                     Laid low their towers and houses frail.
     [java]                     
     [java]                     The mountain smoked beneath the moon;
     [java]                     The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.
     [java]                     They fled their hall to dying -fall
     [java]                     Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.
     [java]                     
     [java]                     Far over the misty mountains grim
     [java]                     To dungeons deep and caverns dim
     [java]                     We must away, ere break of day,
     [java]                     To win our harps and gold from him!
     [java]      
     [java]      As they sang the hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands and by 
     [java] cunning and by magic moving through him, a fierce and jealous love, the desire of 
     [java] the hearts of dwarves. Then something Tookish woke up inside him, and he wished 
     [java] to go and see the great mountains, and hear the pine-trees and the waterfalls, and 
     [java] explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking-stick. He looked out of 
     [java] the window. The stars were out in a dark sky above the trees. He thought of the 
     [java] jewels of the dwarves shining in dark caverns. Suddenly in the wood beyond The 
     [java] Water a flame leapt up--probably somebody lighting a wood-fire-and he thought of 
     [java] plundering dragons settling on his quiet Hill and kindling it all to flames. He 
     [java] shuddered; and very quickly he was plain Mr. Baggins of Bag-End, Under-Hill, 
     [java] again.
     [java]      He got up trembling. He had less than half a mind to fetch the lamp, and more 
     [java] than half a mind to pretend to, and go and hide behind the beer barrels in the cellar, 
     [java] and not come out again until all the dwarves had gone away. Suddenly he found 
     [java] that the music and the singing had stopped, and they were all looking at him with 
     [java] eyes shining in the dark.
     [java]      "Where are you going?" said Thorin, in a tone that seemed to show that he 
     [java] guessed both halves of the hobbit's mind.
     [java]      "What about a little light?" said Bilbo apologetically.
     [java]      "We like the dark," said the dwarves. "Dark for dark business! There are 
     [java] many hours before dawn."
     [java]      "Of course!" said Bilbo, and sat down in a hurry. He missed the stool and sat 
     [java] in the fender, knocking over the poker and shovel with a crash.
     [java]      "Hush!" said Gandalf. "Let Thorin speak!" And this is bow Thorin began.
     [java]      "Gandalf, dwarves and Mr. Baggins! We are not together in the house of our 
     [java] friend and fellow conspirator, this most excellent and audacious hobbit – may the 
     [java] hair on his toes never fall out! all praise to his wine and ale! –" He paused for 
     [java] breath and for a polite remark from the hobbit, but the compliments were quite lost 
     [java] on poor Bilbo Baggins, who was wagging his mouth in protest at being called 
     [java] audacious and worst of all fellow conspirator, though no noise came out, he was so 
     [java] flummoxed. So Thorin went on:
     [java]      "We are met to discuss our plans, our ways, means, policy and devices. We 
     [java] shall soon before the break of day start on our long journey, a journey from which 
     [java] some of us, or perhaps all of us (except our friend and counsellor, the ingenious 
     [java] wizard Gandalf) may never return. It is a solemn moment. Our object is, I take it, 
     [java] well known to us all. To the estimable Mr. Baggins, and perhaps to one or two of 
     [java] the younger dwarves (I think I should be right in naming Kili and Fili, for instance), 
     [java] the exact situation at the moment may require a little brief explanation-"
     [java]      This was Thorin's style. He was an important dwarf. If he had been allowed, 
     [java] he would probably have gone on like this until he was out of breath, without telling 
     [java] any one there 'anything that was not known already. But he was rudely interrupted. 
     [java] Poor Bilbo couldn't bear it any longer. At may never return he began to feel a 
     [java] shriek coming up inside, and very soon it burst out like the whistle of an engine 
     [java] coming out of a tunnel. All the dwarves sprang Bp knocking over the table. Gandalf 
     [java] struck a blue light on the end of his magic staff, and in its firework glare the poor 
     [java] little hobbit could be seen kneeling on the hearth-rug, shaking like a jelly that was 
     [java] melting. Then he fell flat on the floor, and kept on calling out "struck by lightning, 
     [java] struck by lightning!" over and over again; and that was all they could get out of him 
     [java] for a long time. So they took him and laid him out of the way on the drawing-room 
     [java] sofa with a drink at his elbow, and they went back to their dark business.
     [java]      "Excitable little fellow," said Gandalf, as they sat down again. "Gets funny 
     [java] queer fits, but he is one of the best, one of the best-as fierce as a dragon in a pinch."
     [java]      If you have ever seen a dragon in a pinch, you will realize that this was only 
     [java] poetical exaggeration applied to any hobbit, even to Old Took's great-granduncle 
     [java] Bullroarer, who was so huge (for a hobbit) that he could ride a horse. He charged 
     [java] the ranks of the goblins of Mount Gram in the Battle of the Green Fields, and 
     [java] knocked their king Golfimbul's head clean off with a wooden club. It sailed a 
     [java] hundred yards through the air and went down a rabbit hole, and in this way the 
     [java] battle was won and the game of Golf invented at the same moment.
     [java]      In the meanwhile, however, Bullroarer's gentler descendant was reviving in 
     [java] the drawing-room. After a while and a drink he crept nervously to the door of the 
     [java] parlour. This is what he heard, Gloin speaking: "Humph!" (or some snort more or 
     [java] less like that). "Will he do, do you think? It is all very well for Gandalf to talk 
     [java] about this hobbit being fierce, but one shriek like that in a moment of excitement 
     [java] would be enough to wake the dragon and all his relatives, and kill the lot of us. I 
     [java] think it sounded more like fright than excitement! In fact, if it bad not been for the 
     [java] sign on the door, I should have been sure we had come to the wrong house. As soon 
     [java] as I clapped eyes on the little fellow bobbing and puffing on the mat, I had my 
     [java] doubts. He looks more like a grocer-than a burglar!"
     [java]      Then Mr. Baggins turned the handle and went in. The Took side had won. He 
     [java] suddenly felt he would go without bed and breakfast to be thought fierce. As for 
     [java] little fellow bobbing on the mat it almost made him really fierce. Many a time 
     [java] afterwards the Baggins part regretted what he did now, and he said to himself: 
     [java] "Bilbo, you were a fool; you walked right in and put your foot in it."
     [java]      "Pardon me," he said, "if I have overheard words that you were saying. I don't 
     [java] pretend to understand what you are talking about, or your reference to burglars, but 
     [java] I think I am right in believing" (this is what he called being on his dignity) "that 
     [java] you think I am no good. I will show you. I have no signs on my door-it was painted 
     [java] a week ago-, and I am quite sure you have come to the wrong house. As soon as I 
     [java] saw your funny faces on the door-step, I had my doubts. But treat it as the right 
     [java] one. Tell me what you want done, and I will try it, if I have to walk from here to the 
     [java] East of East and fight the wild Were-worms in the Last Desert. I had a great-great-
     [java] great-granduncle once, Bullroarer Took, and —"
     [java]      "Yes, yes, but that was long ago," said Gloin. "I was talking about you. And I 
     [java] assure you there is a mark on this door-the usual one in the trade, or used to be. 
     [java] Burglar wants a good job, plenty of Excitement and reasonable Reward, that's how 
     [java] it is usually read. You can say Expert Treasure-hunter instead of Burglar if you 
     [java] like. Some of them do. It's all the same to us. Gandalf told us that there was a man 
     [java] of the sort in these parts looking for a Job at once, and that he had arranged for a 
     [java] meeting here this Wednesday tea-time."
     [java]      "Of course there is a mark," said Gandalf. "I put it there myself. For very 
     [java] good reasons. You asked me to find the fourteenth man for your expedition, and I 
     [java] chose Mr. Baggins. Just let any one say I chose the wrong man or the wrong house, 
     [java] and you can stop at thirteen and have all the bad luck you like, or go back to 
     [java] digging coal."
     [java]      He scowled so angrily at Gloin that the dwarf huddled back in his chair; and 
     [java] when Bilbo tried to open his mouth to ask a question, he turned and frowned at him 
     [java] and stuck oat his bushy eyebrows, till Bilbo shut his mouth tight with a snap. 
     [java] "That's right," said Gandalf. "Let's have no more argument. I have chosen Mr. 
     [java] Baggins and that ought to be enough for all of you. If I say he is a Burglar, a 
     [java] Burglar he is, or will be when the time comes. There is a lot more in him than you 
     [java] guess, and a deal more than he has any idea of himself. You may (possibly) all live 
     [java] to thank me yet. Now Bilbo, my boy, fetch the lamp, and let's have little light on 
     [java] this!"
     [java]      On the table in the light of a big lamp with a red shad he spread a piece of 
     [java] parchment rather like a map.
     [java]      "This was made by Thror, your grandfather, Thorin, he said in answer to the 
     [java] dwarves' excited questions. "It is a plan of the Mountain."
     [java]      "I don't see that this will help us much," said Thorin disappointedly after a 
     [java] glance. "I remember the Mountain well enough and the lands about it. And I know 
     [java] where Mirkwood is, and the Withered Heath where the great dragons bred."
     [java]      "There is a dragon marked in red on the Mountain, said Balin, "but it will be 
     [java] easy enough to find him without that, if ever we arrive there."
     [java]      "There is one point that you haven't noticed," said the wizard, "and that is the 
     [java] secret entrance. You see that rune on the West side, and the hand pointing to it 
     [java] from the other runes?** That marks a hidden passage to the Lower Halls.
     [java]      "It may have been secret once," said Thorin, "but how do we know that it is 
     [java] secret any longer? Old Smaug had lived there long enough now to find out anything 
     [java] there is to know about those caves."
     [java]      "He may-but he can't have used it for years and years. "Why?"
     [java]      "Because it is too small. 'Five feet high the door and three may walk abreast' 
     [java] say the runes, but Smaug could not creep into a hole that size, not even when he 
     [java] was a young dragon, certainly not after devouring so many of the dwarves and men 
     [java] of Dale."
     [java]      "It seems a great big hole to me," squeaked Bilbo (who had no experience of 
     [java] dragons and only of hobbit-holes) He was getting excited and interested again, so 
     [java] that he forgot to keep his mouth shut. He loved maps, and in his hall there hung a 
     [java] large one of the Country Round with all his favourite walks marked on it in red ink. 
     [java] "How could such a large door be kept secret from everybody outside, apart from 
     [java] the dragon?" he asked. He was only a little hobbit you must remember.
     [java]      "In lots of ways," said Gandalf. "But in what way this one has been hidden we 
     [java] don't know without going to see. From what it says on the map I should guess there 
     [java] is a closed door which has been made to look exactly like the side of the Mountain. 
     [java] That is the usual dwarves' method- I think that is right, isn't it?" "Quite right," said 
     [java] Thorin.
     [java]      "Also," went on Gandalf, "I forgot to mention that with the map went a key, a 
     [java] small and curious key. Here it is!" he said, and handed to Thorin a key with a long 
     [java] barrel and intricate wards, made of silver. "Keep it safe!"
     [java]      "Indeed I will," said Thorin, and he fastened it upon a fine chain that hung 
     [java] about his neck and under his jacket. "Now things begin to look more hopeful. This 
     [java] news alters them much for-the better. So far we have had no clear idea what to do. 
     [java] We thought of going East, as quiet and careful as we could, as far as the Long 
     [java] Lake. After that the trouble would begin."
     [java]      "A long time before that, if I know anything about the loads East," interrupted 
     [java] Gandalf.
     [java]      "We might go from there up along the River Running," went on Thorin taking 
     [java] no notice, "and so to the ruins of Dale-the old town in the valley there, under the 
     [java] shadow of the Mountain. But we none of us liked the idea of the Front Gate. The 
     [java] river runs right out of it through the great cliff at the South of the Mountain, and out 
     [java] of it comes the dragon too-far too often, unless he has changed."
     [java]      "That would be no good," said the wizard, "not without a mighty Warrior, 
     [java] even a Hero. I tried to find one; but warriors are busy fighting one another in 
     [java] distant lands, and in this neighbourhood heroes are scarce, or simply lot to be 
     [java] found. Swords in these parts are mostly blunt, and axes are used for trees, and 
     [java] shields as cradles or dish-covers; and dragons are comfortably far-off (and 
     [java] therefore legendary). That is why I settled on burglary-especially when I 
     [java] remembered the existence of a Side-door. And here is our little Bilbo Baggins, the 
     [java] burglar, the chosen and selected burglar. So now let's get on and make some plans."
     [java]      "Very well then," said Thorin, "supposing the burglar-expert gives us some 
     [java] ideas or suggestions." He turned with mock-politeness to Bilbo.
     [java]      "First I should like to know a bit more about things," said he, feeling all 
     [java] confused and a bit shaky inside, but so far still lookishly determined to go on with 
     [java] things. "I mean about the gold and the dragon, and all that, and how it got there, 
     [java] and who it belongs to, and so on and further."
     [java]      "Bless me!" said Thorin, "haven't you got a map? and didn't you hear our 
     [java] song? and haven't we been talking about all this for hours?"
     [java]      "All the same, I should like it all plain and clear," said he obstinately, putting 
     [java] on his business manner (usually reserved for people who tried to borrow money off 
     [java] him), and doing his best to appear wise and prudent and professional and live up to 
     [java] Gandalf's recommendation. "Also I should like to know about risks, out-of-pocket 
     [java] expenses, time required and remuneration, and so forth"-by which he meant: "What 
     [java] am I going to get out of it? and am I going to come back alive?"
     [java]      "O very well," said Thorin. "Long ago in my grandfather Thror's time our 
     [java] family was driven out of the far North, and came back with all their wealth and 
     [java] their tools to this Mountain on the map. It had been discovered by my far ancestor, 
     [java] Thrain the Old, but now they mined and they tunnelled and they made huger halls 
     [java] and greater workshops -and in addition I believe they found a good deal of gold 
     [java] and a great many jewels too. Anyway they grew immensely rich and famous, and 
     [java] my grandfather was King under the Mountain again and treated with great 
     [java] reverence by the mortal men, who lived to the South, and were gradually spreading 
     [java] up the Running River as far as the valley overshadowed by the Mountain. They 
     [java] built the merry town of Dale there in those days. Kings used to send for our smiths, 
     [java] and reward even the least skilful most richly. Fathers would beg us to take their 
     [java] sons as apprentices, and pay us handsomely, especially in food-supplies, which we 
     [java] never bothered to grow or find for ourselves. Altogether those were good days for 
     [java] us, and the poorest of us had money to spend and to lend, and leisure to make 
     [java] beautiful things just for the. fun of it, not to speak of the most marvellous and 
     [java] magical toys, the like of which is not to be found in the world now-a-days. So my 
     [java] grandfather's halls became full of armour and jewels and carvings and cups, and the 
     [java] toy-market of Dale was the wonder of the North.
     [java]      "Undoubtedly that was what brought the dragon. Dragons steal gold and 
     [java] jewels, you know, from men and elves and dwarves, wherever they can find them; 
     [java] and they guard their plunder as long as they live (which is practically forever, 
     [java] unless they are killed), and never enjoy a brass ring of it. Indeed they hardly know a 
     [java] good bit of work from a bad, though they usually have a good notion of the current 
     [java] market value; and they can't make a thing for themselves, not even mend a little 
     [java] loose scale of their armour. There were lots of dragons in the North in those days, 
     [java] and gold was probably getting scarce up there, with the dwarves flying south or 
     [java] getting killed, and all the general waste and destruction that dragons make going 
     [java] from bad to worse. There was a most specially greedy, strong and wicked worm 
     [java] called Smaug. One day he flew up into the air and came south. The first we heard 
     [java] of it was a noise like a hurricane coming from the North, and the pine-trees on the 
     [java] Mountain creaking and cracking in the wind. Some of the dwarves who happened 
     [java] to be outside (I was one luckily -a fine adventurous lad in those days, always 
     [java] wandering about, and it saved my life that day)-well, from a good way off we saw 
     [java] the dragon settle on our mountain in a spout of flame. Then he came down the 
     [java] slopes and when he reached the woods they all went up in fire. By that time all the 
     [java] bells were ringing in Dale and the warriors were arming. The dwarves rushed out of 
     [java] their great gate; but there was the dragon waiting for them. None escaped that way. 
     [java] The river rushed up in steam and a fog fell on Dale, and in the fog the dragon came 
     [java] on them and destroyed most of the warriors-the usual unhappy story, it was only too 
     [java] common in those days. Then he went back and crept in through the Front Gate and 
     [java] routed out all the halls, and lanes, and tunnels, alleys, cellars, mansions and 
     [java] passages. After that there were no dwarves left alive inside, and he took all their 
     [java] wealth for himself. Probably, for that is the dragons' way, he has piled it all up in a 
     [java] great heap far inside, and sleeps on it for a bed. Later he used to crawl out of the 
     [java] great gate and come by night to Dale, and carry away people, especially maidens, 
     [java] to eat, until Dale was ruined, and all the people dead or gone. What goes on there 
     [java] now I don't know for certain, but I don't suppose anyone lives nearer to the 
     [java] Mountain than the far edge of the Long Lake now-a-days.
     [java]      "The few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding, and cursed 
     [java] Smaug; and there we were unexpectedly joined by my father and my grandfather 
     [java] with singed beards. They looked very grim but they said very little. When I asked 
     [java] how they had got away, they told me to hold my tongue, and said that one day in 
     [java] the proper time I should know. After that we went away, and we have had to earn 
     [java] our livings as best we could up and down the lands, often enough sinking as low as 
     [java] blacksmith-work or even coalmining. But we have never forgotten our stolen 
     [java] treasure. And even now, when I will allow we have a good bit laid by and are not 
     [java] so badly off"-here Thorin stroked the gold chain round his neck-"we still mean to 
     [java] get it back, and to bring our curses home to Smaug-if we can.
     [java]      "I have often wondered about my father's and my grandfather's escape. I see 
     [java] now they must have had a private Side-door which only they knew about. But 
     [java] apparently they made a map, and I should like to know how Gandalf got hold of it, 
     [java] and why it did not come down to me, the rightful heir."
     [java]      "I did not 'get hold of it,' I was given it," said the wizard.
     [java]      "Your grandfather Thror was killed, you remember, in the mines of Moria by 
     [java] Azog the Goblin —"
     [java]      "Curse his name, yes," said Thorin.
     [java]      "And Thrain your father went away on the twenty-first of April, a hundred 
     [java] years ago last Thursday, and has never been seen by you since—"
     [java]      "True, true," said Thorin.
     [java]      "Well, your father gave me this to give to you; and if I have chosen my own 
     [java] time and way of handing it over, you can hardly blame me, considering the trouble 
     [java] I had to find you. Your father could not remember his own name when he gave me 
     [java] the paper, and he never told me yours; so on the whole I think I ought to be praised 
     [java] and thanked. Here it is," said he handing the map to Thorin.
     [java]      "I don't understand," said Thorin, and Bilbo felt he would have liked to say 
     [java] the same. The explanation did not seem to explain.
     [java]      "Your grandfather," said the wizard slowly and grimly, "gave the map to his 
     [java] son for safety before he went to the mines of Moria. Your father went away to try 
     [java] his luck with the map after your grandfather was killed; and lots of adventures of a 
     [java] most unpleasant sort he had, but he never got near the Mountain. How he got there 
     [java] I don't know, but I found him a prisoner in the dungeons of the Necromancer."
     [java]      "Whatever were you doing there?" asked Thorin with a shudder, and all the 
     [java] dwarves shivered.
     [java]      "Never you mind. I was finding things out, as usual; and a nasty dangerous 
     [java] business it was. Even I, Gandalf, only just escaped. I tried to save your father, but it 
     [java] was too late. He was witless and wandering, and had forgotten almost everything 
     [java] except the map and the key." "We have long ago paid the goblins of Moria," said 
     [java] Thorin; "we must give a thought to the Necromancer." "Don't be absurd! He is an 
     [java] enemy quite beyond the powers of all the dwarves put together, if they could all be 
     [java] collected again from the four corners of the world. The one thing your father 
     [java] wished was for his son to read the map and use the key. The dragon and the 
     [java] Mountain are more than big enough tasks for you!"
     [java]      "Hear, hear!" said Bilbo, and accidentally said it aloud, "Hear what?" they all 
     [java] said turning suddenly towards him, and he was so flustered that he answered "Hear 
     [java] what I have got to say!" "What's that?" they asked.
     [java]      "Well, I should say that you ought to go East and have a look round. After all 
     [java] there is the Side-door, and dragons must sleep sometimes, I suppose. If you sit on 
     [java] the doorstep long enough, I daresay you will think of something. And well, don't 
     [java] you know, I think we have talked long enough for one night, if you see what I 
     [java] mean. What about bed, and an early start, and all that? I will give you a good 
     [java] breakfast before you go."
     [java]      "Before we go, I suppose you mean," said Thorin. "Aren't you the burglar? 
     [java] And isn't sitting on the door-step your job, not to speak of getting inside the door? 
     [java] But I agree about bed and breakfast. I like eggs with my ham, when starting on a 
     [java] journey: fried not poached, and mind you don't break 'em."
     [java]      After all the others had ordered their breakfasts without so much as a please 
     [java] (which annoyed Bilbo very much), they all got up. The hobbit had to find room for 
     [java] them all, and filled all his spare-rooms and made beds on chairs and sofas, before 
     [java] he got them all stowed and went to his own little bed very tired and not altogether 
     [java] happy. One thing he did make his mind up about was not to bother to get up very 
     [java] early and cook everybody else's wretched breakfast. The Tookishness was wearing 
     [java] off, and he was not now quite so sure that he was going on any journey in the 
     [java] morning. As he lay in bed he could hear Thorin still humming to himself in the best 
     [java] bedroom next to him:
     [java]      
     [java]                     Far over the misty mountains cold
     [java]                     To dungeons deep and caverns old
     [java]                     We must away, ere break of day,
     [java]                     To find our long-forgotten gold.
     [java]      
     [java]      Bilbo went to sleep with that in his ears, and it gave him very uncomfortable 
     [java] dreams. It was long after the break of day, when he woke up.

     [java] MAR PORTUGUÊS
     [java] Ó mar salgado, quanto do teu sal
     [java] São lágrimas de Portugal!
     [java] Por te cruzarmos, quantas mães choraram,
     [java] Quantos filhos em vão rezaram!
     [java] Quantas noivas ficaram por casar
     [java] Para que fosses nosso, ó mar!
     [java] Valeu a pena? Tudo vale a pena
     [java] Se a alma não é pequena.
     [java] Quem quere passar além do Bojador
     [java] Tem que passar além da dor.
     [java] Deus ao mar o perigo e o abismo deu,
     [java] Mas nele é que espelhou o céu.

     [java] Os Lusíadas - Canto I
     [java] 1
     [java] As armas e os barões assinalados,
     [java] Que da ocidental praia Lusitana,
     [java] Por mares nunca de antes navegados,
     [java] Passaram ainda além da Taprobana,
     [java] Em perigos e guerras esforçados,
     [java] Mais do que prometia a força humana,
     [java] E entre gente remota edificaram
     [java] Novo Reino, que tanto sublimaram;
     [java] 2
     [java] E também as memórias gloriosas
     [java] Daqueles Reis, que foram dilatando
     [java] A Fé, o Império, e as terras viciosas
     [java] De África e de Ásia andaram devastando;
     [java] E aqueles, que por obras valerosas
     [java] Se vão da lei da morte libertando;
     [java] Cantando espalharei por toda parte,
     [java] Se a tanto me ajudar o engenho e arte.
